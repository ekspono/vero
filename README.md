# vero

Vero is a utility belt that can be used to build CLI tools using Babashka. With vero we can write performant and flexible Clojure scripts instead of bash scripts.

Vero is: 

* A library of functions that are useful when writing "bash like" scripts 
* A scaffolding for how to run Babashka scripts with some standardized features on top: argument parsing, config file loading, error handling, etc.

Vero is experimental and not finished. At ekspono we use Vero for all our "scripts". This includes both monorepo utility scripts and cloud infrastructure management scripts.
